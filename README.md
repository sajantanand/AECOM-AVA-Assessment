# AECOM-AVA-Assessment

Project created as part of the RIPS Hong Kong Summer 2018 Program. This project was sponsored by AECOM and is used to assess computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of air flow in Hong Kong. Rather than place test points manually at which the air velocity is measured, we implement an unbiased method to evaluate the impact a proposed building will have on urban air flow.
